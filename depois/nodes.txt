Answer: the correct answer is C) L = K - 1,
which can be derived
from the formula K = 2L - 1 by substituting L = K/2 + 1.
Thus, we have K = 2(K/2 + 1) - 1,
which simplifies to L = K - 1.
This means that the numberof leaves in a binary tree is always
one less than the number of nodes with two children.
